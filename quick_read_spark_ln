Common Spark Issues and How to Fix Them! ðŸ’¡ (Part 1)

âœ… Out of Memory Exceptions
Issue: This occurs when Spark tasks try to process more data than the available memory and leading to crashes.

ðŸ”¸ Resolution: Optimize memory usage by increasing the executor memory (--executor-memory), using data compression formats like Parquet, partitioning large datasets. Caching only relevant data and using columnar storage formats

âœ… Missing Data
Issue: Sometimes, Spark jobs output is incomplete data due to improper handling of null values or faulty logic in transformations.

ðŸ”¸Resolution: we can handle null with na.fill() or na.drop(), double-check join conditions and types. Adding data validation checks before and after jobs can also help us catch such issues early.

âœ… Data Skewness
Issue: Uneven distribution of data can result in some tasks taking significantly longer to process

ðŸ”¸Resolution: Use techniques like salting keys in joins, increasing the number of partitions (repartition() or coalesce()), or using broadcast joins for smaller datasets. 

âœ… Spark Job Repeatedly Fails
Issue: Jobs failing frequently due to various reasons like resource starvation, incorrect configurations, or corrupted data.

ðŸ”¸Resolution: we can Increase retry attempts with spark task maxFailures, and we can verify resource allocations (--num-executors, --executor-memory), and inspect error logs to detect causes.

âœ… FileAlreadyExistsException in Spark Jobs
Issue: This happens when Spark tries to write output files to a location where files already exist, leading to job failures.

ðŸ”¸Resolution: we can clean the output directory by using saveMode("overwrite") to overwrite existing files or explicitly deleting the directory before writing.
